# HTML5 Fullscreen API Attack

## Features

- Emulates UI of:
  - current browser
  - current OS
  - handles arbitrary screen resolutions (fluid UI images)
- Attack works whether user starts out in fullscreen mode or not. In fact, it's even more convincing when user is already fullscreened.
- Attack preloads all images in background so that UI doesn't flash when images are load
